ENGO 651 - Adv. Topics on Geospatial Technologies

I created a website that highlights some of SpaceX's achievements. There are a few pictures and 4 pages in total. You can find the following in each file:
1. 1stpg.html:
	The first page is the Home page and shows a few images of SpaceX products as well as some headlines and descriptions of the images. There is also an alert with an image for wearing a helmet when doing an EVA.
2. 2ndpg.html:
	The second page is the about page and shows another image of the Crew Dragon as well as a few headlines to describe the page and image. There is also a paragraph that highlights the background of SpaceX.
3. 3rdpg.html:
	The third page shows the stats for SpaceX rockets and displays a table with the different launches, landings, and reflown rockets. There is also a headline on this page describing the table.
4. 4thpg.html:
	The fourth and final page of the website is a contact page that includes a contact form to fill out with any information. It does not submit to anywhere but it is functional.
